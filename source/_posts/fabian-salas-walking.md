Two videos from Fabian Salas and his partner Cecilia Gonzalez.

The first one is from the *Tango Fundamentals* course: no ocho, no molinete, just pure elegant walk. The song name is *El pollito* by *Carlos di Sarli*.

A public performance on the song *Gallo Ciego* by *Osvaldo Pugliese*.

I really liked the clearness of their moves and their sense of musicality.

Maximum efficiency with minimum effort.
