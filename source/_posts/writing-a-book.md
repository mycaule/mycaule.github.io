Today I found out some interesting resources for {% link book authoring https://github.com/TalAter/awesome-book-authoring %}.

Software books writer Scott Meyers {% link gives developers tips http://www.aristeia.com/authorAdvice.html %} on how to manage such a project.

As Tim Ferris wrote and proved with the 4-Hour workweek, writing a book can be a one man business muse.

{% link Modern tools https://hackernoon.com/living-the-future-of-technical-writing-2f368bd0a272 %} such as {% link Asciidoc http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/ % } and {% link Atlas https://atlas.oreilly.com %} from O'Reilly can facilitate the workflow so that it very much looks like the workflow of software engineering with build and continuous integration aspects.
