Today, I am learning more about microservices, a subject software architect Martin Fowler has been writing about a lot in his [personal blog](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html).

Kubernetes looks like a cool technology. Google, who supports it, has an online course [Scalable Microservices with Kubernetes](https://www.udacity.com/course/scalable-microservices-with-kubernetes--ud615) intended for both devops and developers.

The course has 4 lessons of 2 hours each for the following topics:
 - Introduction to Microservices
 - Building the Containers with Docker
 - Kubernetes
 - Deploying Microservices

Here are my notes for the lesson 1 [Introduction to microservices](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud615/lessons/7826112332/concepts/81910831080923):

The course uses the following technology to demonstrate : Docker, Go language, Google Cloud Container Engine.

The software industry is pressuring developers to release more often and more quickly. Microservices allows them to do with a simplified lifecycle but require tools to use automation and infrastructure capacity to their limits.

Lesson 1 asks us build a Go project [from Github](https://github.com/udacity/ud615/tree/master/app) which is a webserver doing authentication and building separate microservices from it.

More stuff coming tomorrow with [Lesson 2](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud615/lessons/7826816435/concepts/81980819440923).

## To check later

Kelsey Hightower, main contributor of Kubernetes at Google has written [a more comprehensive tutorial](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way) on GitHub.
