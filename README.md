# Daily microblogging

Personal microblogging project.

## Concept of the blog

The concept would be to write a short post every day that is easy to read.

Every post must emphasize a great idea related to lifestyle and entrepreneurship. It keeps ideas I encounter over time organized and searchable if I need it later.

The layout has to be very simple, most of the time with text only or video only content.

The goal of writing blog posts everyday is to setup a habit of writing and improving my writing skills with time.

Examples of blog that have great style:
- Coding horror - https://blog.codinghorror.com
- This made my day - Discontinued
- Zen Habits - https://zenhabits.net
- Scott Hanselman - https://www.hanselman.com/blog/
- Better explained - https://betterexplained.com
